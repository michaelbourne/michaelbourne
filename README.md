# Hi there, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

A WordPress developer living in Calgary, Canada. I'm the guy behind the scenes at [5forests](https://5forests.com) and [URSA6](https://ursa6.com).

I like to make plugins, tinker with websites, talk at WordCamp and WordPress Meetups, and in general just work with WordPress based sites. When Iâ€™m not in front of a screen, you can bet Iâ€™m in the mountains hiking or at the local pub eating far too many hot wings.
